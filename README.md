## Discalimer

This is a tiny random project because I needed some cute unique descriptors.
This generator is super not safe or not actively maintained and you should *NOT* use it for *ANYTHING*!!!

## Words list sources

Word lists are downloaded on build because I don't think I can legally distribute them.

All credits for actuall lists of words belongs to maintainers and sources
